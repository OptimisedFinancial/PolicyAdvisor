A brand new appraoch for an age old industry.

# Our Vision

Insurance buying is opaque and stressful. At PolicyAdvisor, we’re building a new kind of insurance advisor, built for the way you live. We combine modern technology, intuitive design and human expertise to make insurance buying simpler, straightforward and stress-free.

# Our story

PolicyAdvisor came to be when our founders learnt first-hand that insurance buying is unnecessarily complicated. The industry largely still relies on an archaic in-person application process that just doesn’t make sense in a digital-first world.

With Canadian life insurance ownership now at a multi-decade low and 30% of Canadians lacking any life insurance coverage at all, it’s clear that the old insurance model isn’t working for modern Canucks. So that’s why, we’ve been busy building the tools required to help more Canadians get coverage in a quick, intuitive manner.
