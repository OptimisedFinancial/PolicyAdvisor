A brand new appraoch for an age old industry.

# Our Vision

Insurance buying is opaque and stressful. At PolicyAdvisor, we’re building a new kind of insurance advisor, built for the way you live. We combine modern technology, intuitive design and human expertise to make insurance buying simpler, straightforward and stress-free.

# Our story

[PolicyAdvisor](https://www.policyadvisor.com/) came to be when our founders learnt first-hand that insurance buying is unnecessarily complicated. The industry largely still relies on an archaic in-person application process that just doesn’t make sense in a digital-first world.

With Canadian life insurance ownership now at a multi-decade low and 30% of Canadians lacking any life insurance coverage at all, it’s clear that the old insurance model isn’t working for modern Canucks. So that’s why, we’ve been busy building the tools required to help more Canadians get coverage in a quick, intuitive manner.

# Our process

We’ve built proprietary digital tools that will help you [assess your insurance needs](https://www.policyadvisor.com/app/calculator/insurance_assessment_landing/), within a matter of minutes. We harness data from multiple sources and our algorithms scan hundreds of complex insurance documents to identify the right policy match for you. We then offer you the lowest rates available from a large database of the most trusted insurance companies in the country.

If you’re ever confused somewhere along the way, we also offer a dedicated, licensed insurance concierge to help you complete your insurance forms, update you on the progress of your application and answer your questions, through [phone, email or live chat](https://www.policyadvisor.com/schedule-meeting/).

# Our team

We’re a group of passionate insurance experts, developers, designers and marketers, who share the goal of creating a better insurance-buying experience for Canadians. Our professional expertise across multiple disciplines makes us uniquely capable to bring about innovation to the insurance industry and challenge the status quo. Ah! and did we tell you, we are insurance buyers ourselves.

We’re a 100% independent insurance advisor and we are not owned by an insurance company. We’re registered with and regulated by Financial Securities Commission of Ontario.

# Our customer

We’re building our tools for the digital customers. Those who are forward thinkers and believe that modern technology empowers. Those that believe there must be a better way to buy insurance products. Those that want to be in control while doing so. We’re building PolicyAdvisor to protect you and everything that is important to you.
